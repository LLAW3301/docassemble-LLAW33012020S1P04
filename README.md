# Is my complaint covered by the Equal Opportunity Act?

An Equal Opportunity Jurisdiction Finder created by Amelia Galpin, Holly Langford, Rebecca Rayner and Thomas Ramsey.

The aim of our Application will be to allow individuals direct access to the EOC or another relevant statutory complaints body by asking questions to identify if the EOC would have jurisdiction to assist with their complaint. In cases where the software identifies that the complaint does not fall within the conditions mentioned above, then further questions will be asked and assembled to ensure the user is being directed to an appropriate body for assistance.

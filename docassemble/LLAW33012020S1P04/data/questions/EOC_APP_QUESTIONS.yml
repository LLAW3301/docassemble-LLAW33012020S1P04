question: Are you yourself the person {aggrieved}?
subquestion: |
  You are considered the **person aggrieved** if you are the person that is treated poorly. You are not the person aggrieved if the person who is treated poorly is your friend, colleague, partner, child, or someone else who you have seen, read about or heard about.
  
  You are also **not the person aggrieved** if a discriminatory statement is generalised or sweeping, for example *“all green people need to move to the moon”*. Statements such as this may be dealt with by other areas of the law. Please seek legal advice for more information.

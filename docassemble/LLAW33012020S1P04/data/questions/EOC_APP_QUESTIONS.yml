  Was there discrimination?
subquestion: |
  **Discrimination happens when a person, or a group of people, are treated less favourably than another person or group because of their background or certain characteristics.**
  
  If someone is just being mean or treating you poorly, it may not be discrimination.

    *The Australian Human Rights Commission does not have offices in South Australia. The head office is in Sydney, but officers travel interstate when required.*
    
  *In some cases, the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity can arrange and pay for a party's lawyer if a complaint cannot be resolved and is referred to the South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. This is not the case in the Commonwealth system.*

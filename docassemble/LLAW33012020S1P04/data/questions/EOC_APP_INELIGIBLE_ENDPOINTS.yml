  It is important to pinpoint when the discrimination occurred as it will effect whether your complaint can proceed. 
  
  If the **incident occurred over 12 months ago,** you must provide the Equal Opportunity Commission a good reason for why your complaint is late. The Commissioner will determine whether your complaint may still be accepted. Please contact the Equal Opportunity Commission directly on 08 8207 1997 or email (eoc@agd.sa.gov.au) for further support.
